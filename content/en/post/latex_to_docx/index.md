## Preface on LaTeX and MS Word

I have been using LaTeX for about thirty years to write documents of all
kinds: court documents, reports, research, projects and more.

After overcoming the challenging initial learning curve, therefore, it
is very unlikely that one will go back to "traditional" word processing
systems: the extraordinary typographic quality and considerable time
savings have become indispensable.

Sometimes, however, it is necessary to exchange material written in
LaTeX to friends and colleagues who have not yet had the opportunity to
appreciate it.

In such cases, it is necessary to convert the text into readable word
processing software format. Mainly I am referring to the *.docx* format,
typical of MS Word but also readable by other similar systems, such as
*LibreOffice Writer* that I used for this article.

The conversion procedure is neither unique nor immediate: sometimes it
is necessary to complete the result with some minor intervention.

In this article I explain, without claiming completeness, how I analyzed
and solved this need.

## Conversion through *htlatex*.

In the *TeXLive* distribution there is the *htlatex* command.

The function of *htlatex* is to convert *.tex* format to *.html* format.

Exporting is very simple, just type on the command line:
`htlatex file_name.tex`.

No options and no exported file name: all generated by *htlatex*.

At the outcome of the procedure you get a sequence of documents: one of
them is in *.HTML* format that can be directly in MS Word and saved,
then, in *.docx* format.

The *.docx* version might be fine as long as there are no numbered lists
(typical of witness chapters in court documents) that are affected by
carriage returns added between the sequence number and the content.

Therefore, it is necessary to edit each chapter by removing the carriage
return, and this could be time-consuming in the case of complex
documents perhaps with first- and second-level numbering.

## Conversion through *Pandoc*

An alternative is *[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)*, a universal
cross-platform converter.

For the conversion in question, you type the following command line:
`pandoc inputfile.tex -o outputfile.docx`.

*Pandoc* is very efficient, but sometimes a few minor tweaks need to be
added to get the job done.

Particularly in documents structured with sections, subsections,
numbered lists, and indexes (typical of court documents), I had to make
the following changes:

- Insert "justified" formatting into the basic text: simply edit a
  paragraph with that style sheet and apply the change to all similar
  paragraphs.
- Change the formatting of the First and (if present) Second Level
  headings by changing the color from blue to black. Again, the
  modification of a single First (and Second) Level header can be
  extended to all headers on the same level.
- Delete some unnecessary additions at the beginning of the Document.
- Reinsert (in the case of complex documents), the Table of Contents.
- Fix the numbering of trial chapters and produced documents. In the
  case of sub-numbering, "structure" numbering should be applied to
  obtain the sequence 1.1, 1.2, 2.1, 2.2, etc.

In the end you get a PDF, exported in a format compatible with Microsoft
Word or LibreOffice Writer, with the same structural characteristics as
the original in LaTeX.

## Document export examples

To make the description clearer, I give four examples.

In the first example, I show the PDF obtained from a document directly
from LaTeX:

![](esempio_latex_en.png)

In the second example, I show the outcome of the conversion by applying
the *htlatex* command and then opening, the HTML with LibreOffice Writer:

![](esempio_htlatex_en.png)

In the third example, I show the raw outcome of converting *.tex* to
*.docx* with the *Pandoc* command:

![](esempio_docx_origin_en.png)

In the fourth example I show the reworked outcome of the previous
conversion:

Thank you for your attention.
